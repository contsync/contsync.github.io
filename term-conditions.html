However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. </li>
							<li>48.	There may be times when our Product is facing downtime (planned and unplanned) and is unavailable.
							<li>49.	You accept that, as a limited liability entity, KDPCCL has an interest in limiting the personal liability of its shareholders, directors, officers and employees. You agree that you will also not bring any claim personally against the shareholders, directors, officers or employees of KDPCCL in respect of any losses you suffer in connection with your use of the Product. </li>
							<li>50.	You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless KDPCCL, its shareholders, directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with any of the following: (a) your access to or use of the Product, including information provided in connection therewith; (b) your breach or alleged breach of our Terms of Use; or (c) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully as required by us in the defence or settlement of any claim. </li>
